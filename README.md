This repository contains a bash script demonstrating a race condition bug. The script creates two files and then uses two concurrent processes to write to those files. Due to the race condition, the final output may be incomplete or unexpected, as the order in which the processes write to the files is not guaranteed. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this race condition by using locks or other synchronization mechanisms.
